## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0]

First release of the LLM-pipeline rewrite. Consolidates everything between commit `290fe6f` (the OCR → Ollama swap) and now into one merge to main. The `feat!:` React/Vite migration justifies the major-version bump.

### Changes

- **Breaking** — frontend rewritten in **React + Vite + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui** (was vanilla JS/CSS). Dictionary UI redesigned around the LLM pipeline.
- **Replaced Tesseract OCR with a local Ollama vision model** (`qwen2.5vl:7b` by default) for screenshot title/tag extraction. Configured via `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` / `OLLAMA_MODEL` env vars.
- MP3 encoding switched to VBR; FLAC quality preset improved.

### Additions

- Audio metadata writing on rename (ID3 / FLAC / MP4 via `mutagen`) plus a forced-convert guard that blocks rename of formats that can't carry tags.
- Audio format conversion via `ffmpeg` with quality presets, batch convert mode, and an artist pre-fill in the rename UI.
- New **Patreon URL** input source — shadcn Tabs at the top of the left card switch between **Screenshot** and **Patreon URL**. Pasting a post or creator URL invokes the bundled [`patreon-dl@3.8.1`](https://github.com/patrickkfkan/patreon-dl) to download the audio under `AUDIO_ROOT/.patreon-dl/...` and pre-fills title, tags, and artist from the post's API metadata.
- **Metadata only** checkbox skips the audio download (faster path when the file is already on disk).
- **Patreon Cookie** tab in the Tag Dictionary modal: status badge, textarea, save/clear, and a DevTools walkthrough for grabbing the cookie from the browser.
- Title + tag normalisation pipeline shared between the screenshot and Patreon flows (`parseTitleLine` peels embedded pipe / parenthetical tags, then dictionary-normalised and deduped).
- Comprehensive shadcn/ui coverage and a redesigned tag-editing surface.

### Fixes

- Long parenthetical tags, multi-word pill tags, and test pane layout regressions from the React migration.
- When `patreon-dl` exits cleanly but downloads nothing, `/api/patreon/fetch` now returns `hint` + `log_tail` so the failure cause is visible without re-running the binary.

### Other

- Multi-stage production Dockerfile: builds the Vite SPA, installs `patreon-dl@3.8.1` globally, and bundles into a Python 3.14-slim runtime with Node 20 + ffmpeg. All config externalised via env vars (`AUDIO_ROOT`, `DB_PATH`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `OLLAMA_MODEL`).
- Devcontainer installs `patreon-dl@3.8.1` globally via `postStartCommand`.
- New `settings` key/value table in SQLite for storing the Patreon session cookie.
- New backend endpoints: `POST /api/patreon/fetch` (`{url, metadata_only?}` → `{output_dir, count, metadata_only, posts: [{post_id, title, tags, artist, post_dir, audio_path}], hint?, log_tail?}`), `GET`/`PUT /api/settings/patreon-cookie` (JSON or raw `text/plain` body).
- New `backend/patreon_fetch.py` wraps the patreon-dl subprocess and parses each `post-api.json` for title, user-defined tags, and the creator's `full_name` (artist).
- `.github/workflows/build_check.yml` (push/PR CI: lint + tsc + Vite build, Python syntax check) and `.github/workflows/release.yml` (workflow_dispatch → GHCR + draft release with parsed CHANGELOG body) added.
- `CLAUDE.md` added covering architecture, versioning, changelog discipline, commit conventions, and the GitHub Actions release flow.
- DRY refactor of `database.py` and shared patterns centralised across frontend (`lib/api.ts`, `lib/parser.ts`, `lib/types.ts`) and backend (route-level validators in `main.py`).
- README documents the new flow + Patreon endpoints + cookie setup.
- Added `dev.bat` for Windows hosts.
